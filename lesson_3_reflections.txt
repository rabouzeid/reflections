When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?


Describe the differences between forks , branches and clones. When would you use on instead of other.

Fork= on repository
Branch= local
Clones= both

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Not sure of the answer



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans: Automatically might be a logical ending to a change.
